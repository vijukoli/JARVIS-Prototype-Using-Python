J.A.R.V.I.S Prototype

hello my name is Vijay and i'm done this python project for my 5th sem for E&TC Engg. I use python to do this project.

s we know Python is an emerging language so it becomes easy to write a script for Voice Assistant in Python. The instructions for the assistant can be handled as per the requirement of user. Speech recognition is the process of converting speech into text. This is commonly used  in  voice  assistants  like  Alexa,  Siri,  etc.  In  Python  there  is  an  API  called SpeechRecognition which allows us to convert speech into text. It was an interesting task to  make  my  own  assistant.  It  became  easier  to  send  emails  without  typing  any  word, Searching on Google without opening the browser, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music, opening your favorite IDE with the help of a single voice command. In the current scenario, advancement in technologies are such that they can perform any task with  same  effectiveness  or  can  say  more  effectively  than  us.  By  making  this  project,  I realized that the concept of AI in every field is decreasing human effort and saving time. Functionalities of this project include: 1. It can send emails.  2. It can read PDF. 3. It can send text on WhatsApp. 4. It can open command prompt, your favorite IDE, notepad etc. 5. It can play music. 6. It can do Wikipedia searches for you.  7. It can open websites like Google, YouTube, etc., in a web browser. 8. It can give weather forecast. 9. It can give desktop reminders of your choice.  10. It can have some basic conversation. Now the basic question arises in mind that how it is an AI? The virtual assistant that I have created  is  like  if  it  is  not  an  A.I,  but  it  is  the  output  of  a  bundle  of  the  statement.  But fundamentally, the mail purpose of A.I machines is that it can perform human tasks with the same efficiency or even more efficiently than humans. It is a fact that my virtual assistant is not a very good example of A.I., but it is an A.I.
